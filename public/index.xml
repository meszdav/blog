      <description>Introduction I live in Hungary, where the road surface quality is one of the worst in Europe. While I was on the road, I thought several times that it would be good to plan my trip depending on the road quality. In this case I could better enjoy the beauties of my country, and the trips would been more safe. Because of this, I decided to create a proof of concept in this topic.</description>

      <description>The 7 day Project - Human Activity Recognition The Story First of all, this project wasn&amp;rsquo;t 7 days. Eventually I planned for 14 hours, because I only had 14 hours in 7 days. This was &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; a side project next to my work.&#xA;I am writing this description after 14 days. And I guess there were 4 days when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on this project. So I did it in 10 days ðŸ‘Œ.</description>
