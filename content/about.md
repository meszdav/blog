Hi, I'm David passionate about diving into data and extracting insights. I am a data scientist with mechanical engineering background. 
 
I started my professional career as an acoustics engineer, but I quickly realized that I am more interested in the data analysis part of my job. I have been working with data for more than 5 years now, and I am still excited about it. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn new things, use new tools, and automate boring tasks. 

If you have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to contact me. I am always happy to help and discuss new ideas. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meszarosdavid91/)
